# OCR Models Collection

Welcome to our repository, where we have compiled a diverse range of Layout Analysis (LA) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models. 
This collection is aimed at providing researchers, developers, and hobbyists with easy access to a variety of OCR models.

## About OCR

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a field of study that involves the conversion of typed, handwritten, 
or printed text into machine-encoded text. 
OCR technology is used to digitize printed texts, so that they can be electronically edited, searched, 
stored more compactly, and used in machine processes such as machine translation, text-to-speech, and data mining.

We have LA und OCR models for different OCR-Engines
- [Kraken]()
- [Tesseract]()
- [Calamari]()
